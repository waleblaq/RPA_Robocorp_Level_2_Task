Got started using [Robot Framework](https://robocorp.com/docs/languages-and-frameworks/robot-framework/basics) this is the simplest template to start from.

This robot:

- Uses the orders file (.csv ) and complete all the orders in the file.
- Saves each order HTML receipt as a PDF file.
- Embeds the screenshot of the robot to the PDF receipt.
- Creates a ZIP archive of the PDF receipts (one zip archive that contains all the PDF files). Stores the archive in the output directory.
